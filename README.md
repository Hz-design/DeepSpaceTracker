## Deep space object tracker 

### Composition
Deep space tracker has a good ***Composition***, When the packaging arrives there's a physical manual that tells what the systems is capable of doing. Next to that the application guides you through a onboarding which helps the users understand what the tool can do and how the system reacts on it, and there's always a support line, or a FAQ page for help.

While using the application, for example, when the deep sky tracker has selected a object in deep space. The tripod needs to be calibrated. If the users selects and object and want to track it the application suggest the user not to touch the tripod because it's going to be calibrate. Hopefully the user understand the calibration, if not we could always explain why we calibrate.

#### Why we calibrate 
The reason why we calibrate is: When capturing deep space objects there's a need for a lot of light. The more light the better. It's called photons. When the tracker is fixed on a specific deep space object it tries to rotate with earth. With this the camera sensor can capture a lot of light from the same spot, what will result in beautifull images.

### Consistentsy
>Where visual elements, convey meaning it is vital that they are used in the same way".

The Deep space tracker learns what the preferences of the user is. For example if the user, is shooting photo's a lot from the northern hemisphere the user will see more northern hemisphere objects than southern hemisphere objects, the system gradually learns about the user.

#### Appropriate consistency
What can we do to prioritize semantic consistency:
1. Users should be able to transfer their knowledge (For example when the user wants to shoot a certain deep space object and   ) About the system from one tool to others.

### Continuity
The uniterrupted flow of data and interaction within and across tools. What is happening with the data of our users? 

- There should be no reason for the platform to distract or block the user as they complete a task. If the application can connect with the tripod with a special QR-code, when that happens the device will always beconnected like bluetooth devices until the user removes it. It should be removeable from the physical device and digital device.

- Preventing notification déjà vu. How we think we can prevent it or make it less annoying, introducing you to notification to speech. If the user has selected an Deep space object to track, the tracker will notify the user digitally with a prompt message txt and the physical device will say starting to: track this object.. for so many hours.. etc. the goal is to be transparent to the user. This will notify the user that the physical device is starting his task by speaking in voice.

- Also when sending a task from either devices the model will let the user know if it happens. For example: Select a task on the physical device there will be a pop-up message saying "task is underway, please wait" after that "thank you for waiting, task will be executed". Meanwhile the physical device will receive the task and will say the commands. 

- It could also be the other way around when the machine get's calibrated manually the digital system will not interfere. With the physical system the user can still let the system automate without the need of a digital device.
